 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_USBDROM_11U6X
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * The example shows how to us USBD ROM stack to creates a USB to UART0 converter port.
 * <br>
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * Connect the USB cable between micro connector on board and to a host.
 * When connected to Windows host use the .inf included in the project
 * directory to install the driver. For OSx (Mac) host, no drivers are needed.<br>
 *
 * When using  @ref LPCOPEN_11U6X_BOARD_LPCXPRESSO_11U68 boards with a base board you need to remove jumpers 
 * J54 & J55 on base board and power the system through USB port connected to FTDI chip. Note,
 * serial port settings such as baud rate, parity and data bits should be same for FTDI port and 
 * "LPC VCOM port".
 *
