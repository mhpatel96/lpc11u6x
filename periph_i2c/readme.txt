LPC11u6x I2C example
====================

Example description
-------------------
This example shows how to use I2C as master or slave and communicate between Master and
Slave with polling/interrupt mode. (Interrupt mode is default)

After setting up connection, run the example in both the boards. At regular intervals
both the boards will send data as master and receive data from master hence blinking
the LED at regular intervals (Both boards will act as master as well as slave).

Special connection requirements
-------------------------------
Can use NXP Sensor Shield.
